## Deployment
Performing - Great work, app is deployed to gh-pages and is in sync with local version.

## Technical Requirements
Performing - Fulfilled all requirements and is super functional! Interesting way of implementing a timer! Clever but I feel like a bit overkill, checkout `setInterval()`. Additionally there's definitely lots of opportunities to refactor, check comments

## Code Quality
Performing - Code is properly indented. Looks clean. I would really love it if you added some comments to clarify any bit of code that are more complex.

## Creativity/Interface
Performing - Very clean interface. It'd be cool if the timing function influenced the score.
